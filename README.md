The columns in the sorted lists are as follows:

Column 1: The number assigned to the star in the initial catalogue, to identify the star

Column 2: The mass of the star, in solar masses

Column 3: The distance of the star from Earth, in pc

Column 4: The V magnitude of the star

Column 5: The astrometric signal for the star, in microarcsec

Column 6: The signal to noise ratio for the star
